# ShaderMagic: Unity Shader Graph Templates

## Description

Welcome to ShaderMagic! This repository is a collection of useful shader graph templates specifically for Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP). It aims to provide a variety of high-quality, ready-to-use shaders to help both beginners and experienced developers in creating stunning visual effects for their Unity games.

## Features

- **Variety of Shaders:** The repository contains a wide range of shaders, including but not limited to standard surface shaders, post-processing effects, particle shaders, and more complex shaders like water and fire effects.
- **Well-documented:** Each shader graph comes with a comprehensive explanation of how it works, which can be a great learning resource for beginners or anyone interested in shader programming.
- **Customizable:** All shaders are created using Unity's Shader Graph, making them fully customizable. You can tweak existing shaders or combine them to create your unique effects.
- **URP Compatibility:** All the shaders in this repository are compatible with Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

## Usage

Simply create a new material in Unity, then assign one of the shader graphs to it. You can then adjust the shader properties to suit your needs.
